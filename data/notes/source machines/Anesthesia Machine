works by receiving medical gases, controlling their flow,
and mixing them to create a gas mixture for the patient during surgery

Breathing: Anesthesia machines have alarms that detect low
pressure in the breathing circuit, low exhaled tidal volume, and
low exhaled carbon dioxide.

Vital signs: Anesthesia machines can monitor a patient's heart rate,
ECG, blood pressure, and temperature.

End-tidal carbon dioxide: Some anesthesia machines can
monitor end-tidal carbon dioxide.

End-tidal anesthetic concentrations: Some anesthesia machines can
monitor end-tidal anesthetic concentrations.

Minimal alveolar concentration: Some anesthesia machines can
estimate minimal alveolar concentration.
