Flow rate
The flow rate of a rapid infusion system can range from 10 to 1000 milliliters per minute (ml/min). The default infusion rate for some systems is 200 ml/min.

Pressure
The pressure gradient is usually fixed at around 300 mm Hg.

Viscosity
The viscosity of the fluid being administered affects the flow rate. For example, whole blood has a viscosity of about 2.7, while packed cells have a viscosity of about 10.

IV catheter
The length and diameter of the IV catheter are important factors in the flow rate. The diameter, or gauge, has the biggest impact on flow.

Fluid type
Different types of fluids can be administered through a rapid infusion system, including commercial resuscitation fluids, platelets, and erythrocytes.

Bolus
Some systems allow you to deliver a specific volume of fluid, called a bolus.
