Bispectral Index (BIS)
A number from 0 to 100 that indicates a patient's
level of consciousness. A BIS of 0 means no brain activity, 100 means awake,
and values less than 40 indicate a deep hypnotic state.

BIS is used in anesthesia, critical care, and procedural sedation
to assess a patient's response to sedatives.

Multimodality monitoring (MMM)
A tool that monitors changes in physiologic parameters to
detect SBI in comatose patients. These parameters include:

    Intracranial pressure (ICP)
    Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)
    Cerebral blood flow (CBF)
    Brain tissue oxygenation
    Cerebral metabolism
    Electrocortical activity

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
A tool that can measure many physiological parameters, including:
    Hemoglobin
    Oxygen saturations
    H2O concentrations
    Heart, respiration, and Mayer wave
        frequencies, amplitudes, and pulsatility

Event-related potential (ERP)
A measured brain response to a specific sensory, cognitive, or motor event.
